## Maturity Levels by Domain
| Domain                           | Current Level      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Cyber Risk Management and Oversight | Intermediate       |
| Threat Intelligence and Collaboration | Sub-Baseline       |
| Cybersecurity Controls           | Sub-Baseline       |
| External Dependency Management   | Sub-Baseline       |
| Cyber Incident Management        | Intermediate       |

## Key Findings
1. **Cyber Risk Management and Oversight:**
   - Moderate controls in place.
   - Limited integration with strategic objectives.

2. **Threat Intelligence and Collaboration:**
   - Lack of consistent threat-sharing mechanisms.
   - Minimal engagement with external intelligence sources.

3. **Cybersecurity Controls:**
   - Weak secure coding practices.
   - Limited software security reviews.

4. **External Dependency Management:**
   - Insufficient tracking of third-party service providers.
   - Contracts lack detailed cybersecurity requirements.

5. **Cyber Incident Management and Resilience:**
   - Adequate baseline incident response capabilities.
   - Limited frequency of incident response drills.
